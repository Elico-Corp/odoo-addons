===============================
Product Decimal Precision Extra 
===============================

This module corrects the following limitations in OpenERP standard modules:
- In standard product module, standard cost in product_template is defined following 'Account' decimal precision.

This module introduces a new decimal precision 'Standard Cost' so that you can have standard cost different accuracy (eg:4) than the accounting.
This means that you can have 2 digits for the accounting and 4 digits for the standard cost.
